# URGENT TODO: 
- Context flags and states
- D3D11 backend: buffers, shader uniforms, and assert on wrong D3D11 versions
- Audio context and audio buffers

# FUTURE TODO: 
- Enabling MSAA and configuring the amount of subsamples 
- Enabling the depth and stencil tests and configuring their functions 
- Enabling blending and configuring its function 
- Enabling culling and configuring its function and if it should cull from the back or front face 
- Get rid of GLFW and do it the old-fashioned way? Misery.

# BUGS: 
- Zoomed textures in GL
- Weird stretched textures in D3D11
- Blending is not completely correct in D3D11

# TEST: 
- (OpenGL) Shader attribute semantics

# EXAMPLES: 
- A simple and small drawing app
- A simple image manipulation app

# Engine TODO:
- Meshes
- Make a 3D example
- Fonts 
- NUSL -> Nikol Uniform Shading Language
- Resource manager and loaders for each resource
- Scene manager
